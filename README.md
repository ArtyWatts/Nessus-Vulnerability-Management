<h1>Nessus Vulnerability Management</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
First I will install a Windows 10 Virtual Maschine (VM) on Oracle VM VirtualBox.
In the next step I setup Nessus essentials which will be used to scan the Windows 10 VM for vulnerabilities.
Once vulnerabilities are found, I initiate steps to remediate them. 
<br />


<h2>Languages, Applications and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Oracle VM VirtualBox</b>
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
  
<h2>What I learned</h2>

- <b>Setting up & scheduling scans</b>
- <b>Identifying and remediating vulnerabilities with Nessus</b>

 <b>I disabled the Firewall on the Windows VM so our local machine can ping it. In a corporate environment this step would be executed differently.</b>

 <b>Our first scan in nessus will be a vulnerability scan with no credentials provided.</b>

 <b>The first scan result does not retrieve many severe vulnerabilities.</b>

 <b>If we provide nessus with the credentials for the windows VM, the results are drastically different.</b>

<p align="center"> 
 <b>Nessus provides a lot of information on the vulnerabilities and how to fix them. Many of the vulnerabilities can be fixed by keeping the OS updated and by removing any unnecessary software. </b>

 <b>Summary:</b>

<p  align="center"> 
 <b> Fixing every single vulnerability would be out of scope for this exercise. Takeaways are : In a corporate environment, best practices and procedures, like auto-updating the Operating Systems and removing unecessary applications should be followed at all times.
  Frequent vulnerabilityscans are also a great option to increase safety standards. These tasks should be automated as much as possible.
